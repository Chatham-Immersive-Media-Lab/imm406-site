1.	Read Tilt_Five_Design_Tips_and_Guidelines_2022_05_19.pdf
In class, we will explore the technology and collaboratively create a list of various design constraints. Then, we will do science*

*not actually. But the spirit of science!*
•	Anti-aliasing
•	Bright primary colors
•	Repetitive patterns and moire
•	Height/Depth
•	Well effect and parallax
•	Range of head motion
•	Laser pointer accuracy vs. position/height
•	Etc.

Each student will choose a design constraint, and then create a single demonstrative/explorative sketch that both 1) gives the creator of the sketch insight into the design space, and also 2) effectively communicates the space to others.
For example, if we were looking at fine repetitive textures, perhaps there is a room full of objects of varying textures and texture resolutions that look better/worse, laid out along a spectrum. There is clear A/B comparison.

### Rubric
- Is the Constraint stated?
- Is the constrant effectively explored?
- Have you "Shown Me Too Much?"
