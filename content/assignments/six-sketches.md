Create 6 Unique sketches.

## A Sketch
A sketch is an exploration of an idea. Your sketches can be focused on playing with a visual idea, interaction, environment, or anything in between.
Your sketches may be playing with similar ideas, but each one must be unique, and not simple or obvious variations of each other.

## Submission
Take a screenshot, video capture, photograph, or scan of each sketch as appropriate and upload it to the assignment in brightspace.
